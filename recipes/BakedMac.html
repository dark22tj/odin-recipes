        <h2>A family sized Mac and Cheese for all to enjoy</h2>

        <p>This is a rendition of a macaroni and cheese dish a local restaurant makes. It's so rich and decadent I only make it once per year.<br>
            It's not a <em>dieter's friend</em> and you may use any pasta shape you like.</p>
            <div>
                <h4>What you need</h4>

                <h4>How to actually make it</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li><br>
                    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add penne and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes.</li><br>
                    <li>Meanwhile, melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in cream, half-and-half, and garlic salt. Add Gruyere cheese, 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, and Oaxaca cheese. Stir into cream until melted. Drain pasta and add to the sauce; stir to coat.</li><br>
                    <li>Spray a casserole dish with cooking spray and pour in pasta mixture. Sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese.</li><br>
                    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is bubbly and slightly browned, 15 to 20 minutes.</li><br>
                </ol>
